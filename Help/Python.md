# Python

Python for this project is required to run certain scripts and install other dependencies that make the development a smoother experience.

## Install
Download installer for Python 3.7 or newer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (_Do not install Python from the Windows Store as it's not added to the PATH correctly_).
Start the installer and on the `Optional Features` page make sure `pip` is checked. Then,
on the `Advanced Options` page make sure `Add to environment variables` is checked.

Once it is installed you can open `Command Prompt` or `Powershell` and type in:
```
$ pip install pre-commit
```
This will install a package that extends `Git` functionalities, more will be covered during the [setup of Git](/Help/Git.md#hooks)
