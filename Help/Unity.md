# Unity
Unity's infrastructure allows us to easily create complex mixed reality applications. All development scripting is done using C# but all of that is later translated to C++ for runtime code. 

## Install 
From the archive Unity versions download [Unity 2020.3.18f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.18). Clicking `Install this version with Unity Hub` will add this version to your local installed version.
