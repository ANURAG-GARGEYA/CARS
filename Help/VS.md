# Visual Studio

For HoloLens development and debugging Microsoft recommends Visual Studio as the default tool. It also allows for smooth development with Unity and that's why it is the editor of choice for this project. 

## Install
Download [Visual Studio 2019 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) from the official website.

Make sure to check the following during the install:
- .NET desktop development
- Desktop development with C++
- Universal Windows Platform development
- Game development with Unity

It's always possible to add them later using `Visual Studio Installer`.
